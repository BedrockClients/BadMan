**BadMan** is a Utility Mod Client for Minecraft Bedrock Edition Windows 10. We do not condone hacking in realms/servers/worlds that do not allow it.

**BadMan** is a fork of the Horion MC:BE Utility Mod.

**Credits** - Horion Developers for allowing use of the public horion source code and Brendon for making the **Injector.**
